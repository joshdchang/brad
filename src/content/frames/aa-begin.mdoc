### Your first choice.

You are a student in Yale CPSC 183, aka Intro to Law, Technology, and Culture in Fall of 2024. You signed up for the class because you wanted an easy A and heard that the professor was funny.

It is the first day of class. Brad walks onto the podium and starts his usual antics. You're not sure what to make of it, and you're a bit shocked. Brad says his style is not for everyone, and he encourages those who are not feeling it to leave.

You must make your first decision. Do you leave?
