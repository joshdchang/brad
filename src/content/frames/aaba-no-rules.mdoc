### Everyone is as lazy as you are.

By an overwhelming majority the class voted for no rules. You promise yourself to do one or two reading responses in the first half of the semester, but if something comes up you can always do them later. *Great choice*, you think.

After class you go to the front of the room and take a free cupcake, even though you didn't raise your hand at all.
