## Peter leads you to your new home.

He exits the elevator, and Lewis picks your chair back up. Peter leads you past rows and rows of strange objects until he reaches an empty cell. Lewis unties and throws you in, closing the metal bars and sealing your fate.

"Your trial will be in one week," Peter says. "Normally, I'd encourage you to study copyright law, but there's no hope this time. Goodbye."
