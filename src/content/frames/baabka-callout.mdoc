"Do you mean you need a fair use defense?" A voice calls out from the darkness. *Fair Use?*

"Uhâ€¦ yeah, I need something to protect me from Peter's copyright infringement claim."

Someone emerges from the shadows. You recognize them from your 183 lecture. You are embarrassed to explain how you ended up here.
