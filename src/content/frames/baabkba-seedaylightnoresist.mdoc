## You sit still.

As the doors to Sterling open, for the first time in a week, you see the sun. Lewis carries you across Cross Campus and into Woolsey Hall, where your trial occurs.

The doors to Woolsey creak open and Lewis carries your chair down the aisle and onto the stage. In the audience is your entire class, but you're concerned with finding your jury.
