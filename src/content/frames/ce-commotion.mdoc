## Bing.

Just as you are getting settled the elevator beeps.

You peer behind a shelf to find, Peter Salovey?! Just behind him is Pericles Lewis, carrying a chair with a student from your 183 class tied up. *Oh my gosh!*

You watch from a distance as they throw the student in a cell and lock the door, hearing Peter say something about there being no hope studying.
