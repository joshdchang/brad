## "SILENCE!"

The judge stops Peter in his tracks. He tries to argue and the crowd starts to whisper, but the judge, who you interned for last summer, quiets them down. You wait eagerly for the verdict.

"You have made a remarkable defense, and due to the condition of the jury, I have no choice but to set you free."
